Not only that, but those electrical impulses take time to reach our brain, and time to be incorporated into the reality our brain creates for us. So, the brain must predict/invent the future in order for us to perceive the present. Otherwise, the ball would hit us in the face before we moved to catch it. Philosophers have asked the question how do we know our brain is not just sitting in a jar, being fed electrical signals as part of an elaborate simulation? The answer is disturbing because it's conceivable we wouldn't know the difference. This concept is explored by The Matrix series of movies."

Religions are vantage points from which to view the world. Organized religions frequently become aligned with politics and used to push a comingled political/religious agenda which (in my view) is unhealthy. It is this reason that the founders of the United States advocated for the separation of church and state."
