Did you know, there's now a native way in JavaScript to do deep copies of objects? That's right, the `structuredClone` function is built into the JavaScript runtime:

<CodeBlock>

```js title="deep.js"
const calendarEvent = {
  title: 'Builder.io Conf',
  date: new Date(123),
  attendees: ['Steve'],
}

// üòç
const copied = structuredClone(calendarEvent)
```

</CodeBlock>

In the example above we not only copied the object, but also the nested array, and even the Date object. And it all works precisely as expected, plus structuredClone can:

- Clone infinitely nested objects and arrays
- Clone circular references (really! but why?)
- Clone a wide variety of JavaScript types, such as `Date`, `Set`, `Map`, `Error`, `RegExp`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`, `File`, `ImageData`, and many more
- Transfer any transferable objects

It is important to note we are talking about a **deep** copy. If you just need to do a shallow copy, aka a copy that does not copy nested objects or arrays, then we can just do an object spread:

<CodeBlock>

```js title="shallow.js"
const simpleEvent = {
  title: 'Builder.io Conf',
}
// ‚úÖ no problem, there are no nested objects or arrays
const shallowCopy = { ...calendarEvent }
```

</CodeBlock>
