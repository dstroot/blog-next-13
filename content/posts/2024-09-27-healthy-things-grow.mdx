Gardeners don't 'create' or 'produce' tomatoes. They can only create an environment where tomato plants will thrive. When the environment is healthy, growth happens. There are a lot of factors to consider - the quality of the soil, the weather, pests, weeds, the list goes on. When you get it right natural development accelerates.

> “Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.”

The point is healthy things grow without being forced. Similarly to gardeners, as leaders we don't directly "create" products or "produce" sales, our role is create healthy growth in our organizations, and the way we do that is by creating an environment where our **people** can thrive. To do so requires complimentary factors that are similar to soil, water, and sunlight.

Forced business growth is _exhausting_. Natural, organic business growth is _exhilarating_.

The first is a [clear strategy](/posts/2024-04-08-good-strategy) that makes clear tradeoffs as to what is truly important, and provides adequate resources to accomplish. It also must [adapt to the changing conditions](/posts/2024-04-08-planning-vs-reacting) in the world around it.

So what does a healthy environment look like? Is it measurable? What are the essential areas for your business that must be healthy for growth to occur naturally?

- Leadership development
- Employee engagement
- Product optimization
- Budget
- Management and operations
- Objectives and Key Results
- Key performance indicators
- Team function (as opposed to dysfunction)
- Clarity of vision, mission and values
- Strategic planning and implementation
- Communication
- Collaboration
- Culture
- Innovation
- Alignment to business
- Organizational charting
