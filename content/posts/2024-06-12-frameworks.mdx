excerpt: 'According to Ben Horowitz "peacetime" and "wartime" CEOs require radically different management styles. I believe this concept applies to CIOs as well. As an effective CIO, you never just take a job. You are accepting a mission.'

> Peacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage vs. the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the companyâ€™s strengths.
>
> In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a threat can come from a wide range of sources including competition, dramatic macro economic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth.

<span className="text-sm">
  Douglas MacArthur received 13 awards for bravery, including the Medal of
  Honor. Perhaps the most gifted wartime soldier America ever produced, he
  orchestrated remarkable victories in France, New Guinea, the Philippines, and
  Korea. He often led from the front, sharing the dangers of the battlefield
  with his men, which earned him accolades for bravery and the loyalty of his
  soldiers. His tenure was marked by the challenge of leading the Army during
  the Great Depression, a period of limited resources and low morale. Despite
  this, he advocated for a modern, mechanized army, foreseeing the changing
  nature of warfare.
